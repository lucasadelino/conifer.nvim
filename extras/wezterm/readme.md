# Conifer (WezTerm)

## Installation

1. Download the theme file to your WezTerm `themes` folder (most likely
   at `~/.config/wezterm/colors`; you may need to create that directory if
   you haven't already).
2. In your WezTerm config file (e.g. `~/.config/wezterm/wezterm.lua`),
   add the following line:

```lua
config.color_scheme = "Conifer"
```
