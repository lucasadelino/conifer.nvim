# Conifer (ghostty)

## Installation

1. Download the theme file to your ghostty `themes` folder (most likely
   at `~/.config/ghostty/themes/`; you may need to create the `themes`
   folder if this is the first ghostty theme you install).
2. In your ghostty config file (most likely at
   `~/.config/ghostty/config`), add the following line:

```ini
theme = "conifer"
```
