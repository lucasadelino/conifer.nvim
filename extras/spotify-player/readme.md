# Conifer (spotify-player)

## Installation

1. Copy the contents of `theme.toml` into the theme file in your spotify-player
   config folder (at `~/.config/spotify-player/theme.toml`; by default;
   you may need to create the directory if you haven't already).
   - If you don't already have a `theme.toml` file, you can download the one in
   this repo to your spotify-player config folder.
2. In your spotify-player `app.toml` file
   (e.g. `~/.config/spotify-player/app.toml`), add the following line:

```toml
theme = "conifer"
```
