# Conifer

A woodsy Neovim theme

> [!WARNING]
> Conifer should be considered in alpha state. It is my daily driver, and includes support for *some* plugins, but changes to the theme are likely to happen for a while.

## Design principles (tldr)

- Code colors prioritize greens, whites, and browns
- UI colors are vibrant, contrasting with the code color palette, to draw your eye
- Muted diagnostic virtual text colors, to get out of your way

## Design principles

This theme started out as a customization of [OneMonokai](https://github.com/azemoh/vscode-one-monokai), which had, over the course of the 6 years in which I used it exclusively, started to seem a bit too colorful for me.

I first switched to [Everforest](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest), and while I liked that it had less saturation contrast, Everforest still had too much *hue* contrast, and I wanted something with a more muted  color palette. This, in turn, led me to monochrome themes, which were definitely closer to what I wanted, but I wasn't necessarily sold on that level of minimalism.

One thing about monochrome themes was dead-on, though: after a while, your brain *does adapt to lower (hue, saturation) contrasts, and is able to perceive more muted colors with (pretty much) the same clarity as more vibrant ones. If you thought Conifer was interesting, but found it too jarring coming from a colorful theme, just know that it was the same for me, so I'd encourage you to give it a try for at least a couple of days. Muted colors also seem to let you focus one the *shape* of the code (brackets, paragraphs, etc.) a little bit better. I wanted to hopefully preserve these benefits while *also* keeping some colorful greens.

All of this led me to Conifer: a theme where green was the color of the most important keywords, with other colors (blue, brown, etc.) still present, but less prominent. With that in mind, having the colors follow a forest-like theme came very naturally (though the pine-forest aesthetic was, admittedly, a total afterthought).

## Inspiration

- [OneMonokai](https://github.com/azemoh/vscode-one-monokai), for parts of the color palette (such as green for functions, and blue for types)
- [Everforest](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest), for inspiring a forest-themed aesthetic
- [No Clown Fiesta](https://github.com/no-clown-fiesta/no-clown-fiesta.nvim/), for the repo strutcture, and for being a great minimal-ish theme
